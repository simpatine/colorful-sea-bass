\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section we'll look briefly at the results we got from each of the different techniques outlined in \autoref{sec:methods}.

\paragraph{Execution notes.}
All the results were obtained by running our program with about 16 GB of working memory and 1 core per instance. The system running our program was equipped with an Intel Xeon \footnote{The cluster on which we worked on, is more thoroughly described here: \url{https://docs.dei.unipd.it/en/CLUSTER/Overview}}. The runtime for a sweep on the selected subsample rates is on the order of a few hours.

\subsection{Uniform subsampling}

The first simple test was done selecting a random subset of genes. The results for each subsampling rate are shown in \autoref{fig:res1}.

\subsection{Considerations on the results}
Our results suck a lot.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methods}
We tried to evaluate the effectiveness of random subsampling of genes in improving predictions of mortality.

\subsection{Dataset}
% features.csv
The main dataset we used was a table filled with the genome of $990$ individual sea basses.
The sequenced genome at our disposal was made up of $6072853$ individual genes. % TODO: non sono geni, ma mutazioni

% TODO: mortality.csv

In addition to the set of genes for some individuals, we had a set of annotated genes.
For a subset of genes some further information is known: a function (either \texttt{Open\_chromatin}, \texttt{Enhancer} or \texttt{Promoter}) and a tissue number (between $0$ and $25$).

\subsection{Data pipeline}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Subsampling. The idea is to help our estimator to not get lost in the $\sim 10^6$ genes, but allowing it to work with only a smaller number of genes at a time. This step is thourghly explained in \autoref{sec:subsample}
    \item Train-test split.
    \item Training. Once we subsampled the dataset,  we used the \texttt{XGBoost}\cite{xgboost} library to construct a predictor in a fast and easy manner. We always used the parameter \texttt{method="hist"}, as we didn't find any meaningful difference between the options and this offers the widest compatibility across devices.
    \item Evaluation.
\end{enumerate}
randomisation...

\subsection{Subsampling techniques}
\label{sec:subsample}
We always subsampled selecting a subset of genes in the whole dataset.


\paragraph{Uniform subsampling.}
The first and simplest thing we tried was to randomly and uniformly subsample the genes on the entire genome.
We selected a given fraction of the genes, keeping or discarding each gene with fixed and uniform probability.

\paragraph{Uniform subsampling on chromosomes.}
A second possibility is to uniformly and randomly sample a fixed number of genes on each chromosome.

\subsection{Annotated genes}
Using the additional information at our disposal we used only a subset of annotated genes. Among these we further subsampled to obtain a small feature set.

\paragraph{Subsampling using annotations.}
Some genes have been linked to specific organs, tissues or functions. This information can be used to select and sample genes with only some function or organ and subsample among these.
